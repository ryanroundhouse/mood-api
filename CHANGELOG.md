## Agent change log

### Unreleased
- **2026-02-14**: Added agent workflow docs (`AGENTS.md`, `STATE.md`, `DECISIONS.md`) and changelog template so future tasks start with clear constraints and end with consistent handoffs.

## Handoff requirements
- Add a bullet for each agent session with **date + what changed + why** (when repo changes were made).
- Update `STATE.md` when structure/commands/testing conventions change.
